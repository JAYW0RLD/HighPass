# Build Artifacts
dist
# dashboard/dist # Keep this if you want to copy pre-built frontend, BUT usually better to build inside or keep cleanly. 
# For now, let's exclude dashboard/dist and assume backend-only serving or hybrid.
# Actually, the server serves `dashboard/dist`. If we exclude it, the container won't have frontend.
# But 690MB is definitely node_modules. Let's keep dashboard/dist commented out (included) if it exists, but exclude node_modules.
